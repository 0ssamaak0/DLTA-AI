Data Labeling, Tracking and Annotation with AI
</h3>

DLTA-AI is the next generation of annotation tools, integrating the power of Computer Vision SOTA models to Labelme in a seamless expirence and intuitive workflow to make creating image datasets easier than ever before


## Why DLTA-AI?
Open source and customizable annotation tool was created to fill a gap in annotation tools.
The customization and giving the user the full control was and will be our priority, from the model selection, input formats and inference parameters, to the export formats and even the User Interface itself. From these options, the goal was to extend the use cases of the concept of annotation tool to other use cases for end users beyond just preparing datasets to train models.
