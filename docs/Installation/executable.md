DLTA-AI is available as an executable, however it's CPU only, so it's not recommended for large datasets. It's currently available for windows and linux only

you can download the [lastest release](https://github.com/0ssamaak0/DLTA-AI/releases) Executable under **Assets** 

The Executable doesn't require any installation, just download and run it from the executable file
