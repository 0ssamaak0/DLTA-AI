# Solutions to possible problems

## 1. (linux devices üêß) 
some linux machines may have this problem 
```
Could not load the Qt platform plugin "xcb" in "/home/<username>/miniconda3/envs/test/lib/python3.8/site-packages/cv2/qt/plugins" even though it was found.
This application failed to start because no Qt platform plugin could be initialized. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.

Available platform plugins are: xcb, eglfs, linuxfb, minimal, minimalegl, offscreen, vnc, wayland-egl, wayland, wayland-xcomposite-egl, wayland-xcomposite-glx, webgl.
```
it can be solved simply be installing opencv-headless
```
pip3 install opencv-python-headless
```
