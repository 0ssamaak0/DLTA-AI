## Installation
Like all other models, The [Model Explorer]("../model_selection/model_explorer.md") can be used to install the checkpoints directly with just a single click

## Segmentation
Segment Anything can be used to make Zero-Shot Segmentation of any object.
DLTA-AI provides an expiernce similar to the [Original Demo](https://segment-anything.com/demo#) with the simple SAM toolbar that supports user-customized shortcuts, and runs locally on the user machine on any image or video.

## Enhance Polygons
Beside the usual functionality of Zero-Shot Segmentation, Segment Anything can be used to enhance the accuracy of any polygon, weather it was created by the user or by any other model, by simply selecting the polygon(s) and enhancing them from the toolbar or the context menu.

## Interpolation Tracking
DLTA-AI utilizes the power of Segment Anything to provide a very accurate interpolation tracking, that can be used to track any object in a video, and can be used to track multiple objects at the same time.
